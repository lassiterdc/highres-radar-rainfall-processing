This repository contains code to download, process, and quality check the [NOAA's Surface Precipitation Rate product](https://vlab.noaa.gov/web/wdtd/-/surface-precipitation-rate-spr-?selectedFolder=9234881) for use with
[RainyDay](https://github.com/danielbwright/RainyDay) which performs stochastic storm transposition using gridded rainfall products. The repository also contains code for comparing the radar rainfall data with a gage network.
